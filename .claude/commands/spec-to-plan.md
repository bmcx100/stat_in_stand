Write a detailed step-by-step implementation plan for the spec file: $ARGUMENTS

Instructions:

1. Read the spec file provided
2. Ask any clarifying questions you have BEFORE writing the plan
3. Write a detailed implementation plan to `.claude/plans/` — use the same filename as the spec but replace `.md` with `-plan.md` (e.g. `foo.md` → `foo-plan.md`)
4. STOP IMMEDIATELY after writing the plan file. Do not create, modify, or delete any other files. Do not write any code. Do not take any further actions.
5. Treat this task as complete the moment the plan file is written. Any further tool calls after writing the plan file are a mistake.

The plan should include:

- Overview of the feature/system
- Step-by-step implementation phases
- Files that will need to be created or modified
- Any dependencies or prerequisites
- Potential risks or considerations

After writing the plan file, output only: "Plan written to .claude/plans/[filename]. Review it and let me know when you're ready to implement."
Then stop. Do not do anything else.
